## How to Run
 First compile the program using the following command:
```bash
g++ -std=c++11 main.cpp -o linkedlist_demo
```
Then run the program using the following command:
```bash
./linkedlist_demo
```

#### Input Options:
Enter **1** to test inserting before and after a specific node in an integer list.
Enter **2** to test inserting nodes at specific positions in a string list.
